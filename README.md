# README Generator 

## Description
As my first back-end project, this assignment encompassed creating a README.md template through Node.Js. I was tasked with developing an application that would use an inquirer package to then ask questions through an integrated terminal or a similar back-end application. Through use of an index.js file and a generated markdown, the finished product would show a templated README.md file.

## Installation 
- Node.js
- Inquirer package
- Clone git@github.com:dylankreisman/Readme-generator.git

## License
None.

## Usage
Start with installing inquirer along with the FS and generateMarkdown packages. Then, create an object in the index.js and move on to writing functions on the bottom. 

After that, create a function in the generateMarkdown.js and use temperate literals to outline the README sections.
